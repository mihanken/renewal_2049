## How to contribute to flipsnap.js

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/hokaccha/js-flipsnap/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.
* Before sending a pull request for a feature or bug fix, be sure to have [tests](https://github.com/hokaccha/js-flipsnap/blob/master/test/index.html).
* In your pull request, do not add rebuild the minified flipsnap.min.js file. We'll do that before cutting a new release.
* All pull requests should be made to the `master` branch.
